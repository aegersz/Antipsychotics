# 🧠 Why Does My Hand Shake on Clopixol?

## 🔬 Root Cause: Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)

**Clopixol (Zuclopenthixol)** is a first-generation antipsychotic known for strong dopamine D2 receptor blockade, especially in the **nigrostriatal pathway** — the brain circuit responsible for movement control.

### 🧠 Mechanism:
- ↓ Dopamine in motor regions
- ↑ Risk of Parkinsonism-like symptoms:
  - 🫱 Hand tremors
  - 🪑 Slowed movement (bradykinesia)
  - 💀 Muscle stiffness
  - 🧍 Stooped posture or gait changes

## 🧬 Why It Happens After Long-Term Olanzapine Use

If you've been on **Olanzapine for 25 years**:
- Your brain has **adjusted** to milder D2 blocking
- Switching to **Clopixol**, with **stronger D2 antagonism**, can **shock the system**
- Dopamine receptor upregulation = **dopamine supersensitivity**, now **overcorrected** by Clopixol

## 📉 EPS Risk Comparison

| Medication        | EPS Risk        | Notes                                 |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Olanzapine        | Low–Moderate     | Anticholinergic effect mitigates EPS   |
| Clopixol (oral)   | Moderate–High    | Strong D2 blockade, weak serotonin     |
| Clopixol Depot    | High             | Long-lasting D2 suppression            |

## ✅ How to Manage the Hand Tremor

### 1. **Dose Adjustments**
- Reduce Clopixol dose slightly
- Use split dosing (AM/PM)

### 2. **Add-on Medications**
- 🧠 **Benzatropine (Cogentin)** — standard for EPS
- 🚶 **Procyclidine** or **Trihexyphenidyl**
- 💓 **Propranolol** — best for tremors/akathisia
- 🧃 **Vitamin B6** (off-label benefit)
- 💊 **Amantadine** (dopamine enhancer)

---

## 🚨 When to Worry

Seek urgent help if:
- Tremor spreads or worsens
- You feel severe internal restlessness (akathisia)
- Muscle contractions in the neck/face
- Jaw chewing or tongue rolling (tardive signs)

---

## 🔄 Long-Term Solutions

- Try a **lower-EPS atypical antipsychotic**:
  - Aripiprazole
  - Quetiapine
  - Lurasidone
- If depot Clopixol is needed:
  - Start at a **very low dose**
  - Co-administer with **EPS prophylactics**

---

## 💬 Summary

Your hand is shaking because Clopixol is:
- Stronger at D2 than Olanzapine
- Less protective against EPS
- Possibly hitting a hypersensitized dopamine system after years on a softer blocker

**Early treatment can reverse symptoms and avoid long-term motor damage.**
